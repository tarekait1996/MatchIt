# The MatchIt App (Shopify Challenge 2020)
  This is an Android mobile game created by me to showcase my mobile development skills for the Shopify internship opportunity for summer 2020. The images that are shown do not belong to me but where simply found on Google as the JSON provided had links that gave me a 404 error :). Enjoy the game. I had fun coding it and I hope you have fun playing it :D. **OH AND DO NOT FORGET, YOU GOTTA MATCH THEM ALL**!
